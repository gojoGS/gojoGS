### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you are here, chances are you know who I am. For the rest of you, nice to meet you!

I'm a software engineer, with some experience in the industry, still much to learn. 

Some may call me a backend dev, a fullstack dev, a webdev, but as all sorts of responsibilities and tasks have been dumped on me (I'm looking at you, internal, quirky, undocumented test automation tool), I'll go with being a software engineer.

I've worked and would be happy to work with Java, Kotlin, C#, TypeScript, Rust, Spring Boot, Jetpack Compose, React, Tailwind, DaisyUI aaaaaaand Docker of course.

#### I'm currently working on...
- a CMS called **Hermes**
- a log pager/tailer/viewer called **Heimdall**
  
#### I'm planning on making...
- a knowledge-base called **Athene**
- a collaborative shopping app called **Karavan**   

I really like to try new things, and make my own tools, so I hope this will explain this long(er than realistic) list of ideas. They'll never be finished probably, but hey, at least I tried.
